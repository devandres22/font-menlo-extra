font-menlo-extra
================

### What?
`Menlo Regular`, patched to support glyphs from FontAwesome, Powerline, Octicons and more.

### Why?
As I found, [everyone](https://github.com/gabrielelana/awesome-terminal-fonts) [else](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts) uses `Meslo` - customized version of `Menlo` with 'fixed' verical line spacing and changes baseline alignment of asterisk.

As for me, I like original `Menlo` spacings and aligns, so I decided to stick with original `Menlo`, but to patch it to add support for glyphs and icons from other modern and popular libs/collections.

### Used icons/collections
+ Font Awesome (+ andrelzgava/font-awesome-extension)
+ Material Design Icons
+ Octicons
+ Powerline (inc. ryanoasis/powerline-extra-symbols)
+ Pomicon
+ Weather Icons
+ IEC Power Symbols
+ Font Linux

### Who is who
+ `Menlo-Regular-Full` - font with all icons and glyphs.
+ `Menlo-Regular-Normal` - font with added `powerline`(with ext), `font awesome`(with ext) and `octicons`.
+ `Menlo-Regular-NormalV2` - same as `Menlo-Regular-Normal`, but with aligned `powerline` glyphs.
+ `Menlo-Regular-*-Mono` - monospace variant (single-width glyphs).
